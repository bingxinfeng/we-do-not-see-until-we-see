Interactive Installation

We do not See Until We See is an analog and digital interactive installation, an abstraction of the state of how we perceive matters around us. A tank with unnoticeably flowing water and a mirror at the centre, and a screen against the tank displaying live-generated digital abstract flow construct a symmetrical scene. When there is a viewer looks straight into in the mirror within the tank, his/her reflected face captured by the webcam above would trigger the system, then he/she would see the flow getting more noticeable, eventually distorting his/her reflected image. Meanwhile, the surrounding audience would also witness the flow from that viewerâ€™s distorted image on the screen. The flow would not be perceived clearly until we seeing ourselves under its influence - Not only the flow of water in the tank, but also the flow of politics, culture, ecosystem etc.
